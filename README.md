# Django-Blogging-System
Hey everyone, my name is Henry and welcome to building a blog application tutorial with python 3 and Django web framework.
One of the main question developers ask is, why create a blog application tutorial? It seems like everyone recreate a blog as a 
first application. Well, there is a reason for that, first of all. Everyone knows how a blog works and this make it easy for 
learning. When I tell you we are creating a blog, you automatically know that there is some sort of authentication system, 
posts are going to be the main element, there will be a page that list all the post in a particular order e.g chronologically 
and you also know each of these post will have comments.
